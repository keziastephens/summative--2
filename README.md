Hello! Welcome to my Second Summative of Winterscapes for Tourism New Zealand.
There are a few things you need to do in order to get the website working to its full potential.
Within the js folder, you will see a file named mapKeyCopy.js.
In order to get maps working you will need to do the following:

Step One: Grab your api key.
Step Two: Rename mapKeyCopy.js to mapKey.js (just take out the Copy)
Step Three: Insert your api key between the quotation marks after let key =

It will look like this:
let key = "your api key will be here"

Sweet! You are ready to go and can see the website with a map!
