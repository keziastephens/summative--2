Hello! Welcome to my Second Summative of Winterscapes for Tourism New Zealand.
There are a few things you need to do in order to get the website working to its full potential.
Within the js folder, you will see a file named mapKeyCopy.js.
In order to get maps working you will need to do the following:

Step One: Grab your api key.
Step Two: Rename mapKeyCopy.js to mapKey.js (just take out the Copy)
Step Three: Insert your api key between the quotation marks after let key =

It will look like this:
let key = "your api key will be here"

Make sure you are authorizing your API key by adding the URL to the list of recognized URLs. You can do this through the edit tab of the credentials API keys on google cloud platform. 

Sweet! You are ready to go and can see the website with a map!
